# Data Science Course Project
## You on Web (Data Science Course Project)

#### Project Summary
* We are active on the web from anywhere between 10-20 years.
* How many websites or applications a user visit regularly for a long time? May be maximum 5*.
* We leave a long trial of information while using these websites that we ourselves will not remember over time.
* Can we have an application which can help us view our past usage of these websites in a summarized manner?
* We aim to build a personal space of a user where he can view his usage of various web products to get interesting analytics and insights from his content consumption on these websites.
* In the current scope of this project, we are targeting study of “Youtube Watch History” and “Android Activity” data as collected by Google and provided through Google Takeout. This can be extended to other web products gradually.
